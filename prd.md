# Product Requirements Document: CogMem Library

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Placeholder)
**Authors:** AI Language Model based on provided context

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities but face limitations in maintaining long-term memory, context across interactions, adapting over time, and collaborating effectively, especially in multi-user or multi-agent scenarios. Existing solutions often lack sophisticated memory management, multi-tenancy support, and easy customization.

The **CogMem Library** aims to provide developers and researchers with a robust, flexible, and performant software library (primarily in Go, with embedded Lua scripting) for building LLM-based agents with advanced cognitive capabilities. It synthesizes research in cognitive architectures, tiered memory systems, dynamic memory processing, reflection, and introduces first-class support for multi-entity context management and scriptable customization. CogMem positions managed, contextual memory as a cornerstone for creating more coherent, adaptive, collaborative, and capable AI agents.

## 2. Goals

*   **Provide a Modular Architecture:** Offer distinct, interchangeable components (Perception, Memory, Reasoning, Reflection, Action) inspired by cognitive architectures.
*   **Implement Advanced Memory Management:** Enable sophisticated memory handling beyond basic RAG, including tiered memory (WM/LTM) and an explicit Memory Management Unit (MMU).
*   **Support Robust Long-Term Memory:** Provide interfaces and support for diverse, persistent LTM backends (vector, structured, temporal knowledge graphs) capable of storing varied information types.
*   **Enable Multi-Entity Awareness:** Natively support partitioning memory and operations based on entities (e.g., users, groups, organizations) ensuring data isolation.
*   **Facilitate Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Allow controlled sharing of memory segments between agents operating within the same entity context.
*   **Incorporate Dynamic Memory Processes:** Support context-aware retrieval, iterative refinement, temporal reasoning, and memory consolidation.
*   **Enable Reflective Adaptation:** Include a mechanism for agents to analyze past performance and adapt their knowledge and strategies (self-evolution).
*   **Offer High Flexibility via Scripting:** Integrate embedded Lua (`gopher-lua`) to allow customization of core logic (MMU strategies, reflection rules, etc.) without recompiling the Go core.
*   **Deliver a Performant Go Library:** Prioritize Go for its performance, concurrency, and suitability for backend systems, providing a library for integration into larger applications.
*   **Promote Responsible AI Development:** Focus on functional capabilities and avoid unsubstantiated anthropomorphic claims ("Cognitive Mirage").

## 3. Non-Goals

*   **Not a complete, standalone Agent Framework:** CogMem provides the cognitive core (especially memory and reflection); it's not intended to be a full end-to-end agent platform with UI, deployment tools, etc., out-of-the-box.
*   **Not claiming true AGI or Consciousness:** The architecture draws inspiration from cognitive science but focuses on functional enhancements, not replicating human cognition.
*   **No initial native Python implementation:** While Python support/wrappers are a future consideration, the primary initial implementation and focus will be Golang.
*   **Not providing specific UI components:** The library focuses on the backend cognitive engine.
*   **Not dictating specific LLM usage:** The library will interface with LLMs but remain agnostic to the specific model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.).
*   **Not enforcing a single LTM backend:** The library will provide interfaces; users choose and configure specific database implementations.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **AI/ML Developers & Engineers:** Building sophisticated LLM-based applications, chatbots, assistants, or autonomous agents requiring state persistence, context management, and adaptation.
*   **AI Researchers:** Experimenting with cognitive architectures, memory mechanisms, agent learning, and multi-agent systems.
*   **Software Architects:** Designing systems incorporating LLMs where multi-tenancy, custom logic, and robust memory are critical requirements.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### FR-CORE: Core Architecture & Components

*   **FR-CORE-03:** The Executive Controller MUST manage the overall flow and orchestrate interactions between modules for each agent request/cycle.
*   **FR-CORE-04:** The library MUST be implemented primarily in Golang.

### FR-MEM: Memory System
*   **FR-MEM-01 (Tiered Memory):** The architecture MUST conceptually distinguish between Working Memory (transient, LLM context) and Long-Term Memory (persistent, external).

*   **FR-MEM-03 (MMU Operations):** The MMU MUST provide functions for:
    *   Encoding/writing data to LTM (`encode_to_ltm`).
    *   Retrieving data from LTM (`retrieve_from_ltm`).
    *   Consolidating/updating LTM based on experience or reflection (`consolidate_ltm`).
    *   Managing WM overflow by deciding what to move to LTM (`manage_wm_overflow`).
*   **FR-MEM-04 (LTM Interface):** The library MUST define a clear `LTMStore` interface abstracting specific database implementations.
*   **FR-MEM-05 (LTM Backends):** The LTM interface MUST be designed to support plugging in different backend types, including (but not limited to):
    *   Vector databases (for semantic search).
    *   Structured databases (for facts, profiles).
    *   Temporal Knowledge Graphs (for relational, historical context, e.g., via Zep-like interactions if feasible).
*   **FR-MEM-06 (LTM Content):** The LTM system MUST support storing diverse content types (e.g., text chunks, dialogue history, structured facts, user preferences, episodic tuples, reflective insights).
*   **FR-MEM-07 (Dynamic Retrieval):** The `retrieve_from_ltm` function MUST support various strategies beyond simple vector search, potentially including filtering by time, metadata, context-sensitivity, graph traversal, and iterative refinement loops. Configuration options MUST be provided to select/tune retrieval strategies.
*   **FR-MEM-08 (Consolidation):** The `consolidate_ltm` function MUST allow for intelligent updates to LTM, such as merging related information, updating embeddings/facts, or modifying graph structures.

### FR-MULTI: Multi-Entity & Multi-Agent
*   **FR-MULTI-01 (Entity Context):** All core operations (especially MMU/LTM interactions) MUST operate within an explicit `entity_context` (e.g., defined by a user ID, group ID, or tenant ID).
*   **FR-MULTI-02 (Data Partitioning):** All data stored in LTM MUST be associated with an `entity_id`.
*   **FR-MULTI-03 (Data Isolation):** LTM retrieval operations MUST automatically filter data based on the current `entity_context`, preventing access to data belonging to other entities.
*   **FR-MULTI-04 (Access Levels):** LTM data MUST support basic access level markers (e.g., `private_to_user`, `shared_within_entity`). The specific user ID might be part of the `entity_context` or managed separately.
*   **FR-MULTI-05 (Shared Memory):** The system MUST allow multiple agents operating under the same `entity_id` to read and potentially write to LTM segments marked as `shared_within_entity`.
*   **FR-MULTI-06 (Context Propagation):** The Executive Controller MUST manage and propagate the correct `entity_context` throughout the processing pipeline for each request.

### FR-SCRIPT: Lua Scripting
*   **FR-SCRIPT-01 (Integration):** The library MUST embed a Lua interpreter (`gopher-lua`).
*   **FR-SCRIPT-02 (Extension Points):** Lua scripting MUST be enabled at specific, well-defined extension points within the architecture, including at minimum:

    *   Reflection Module: Defining analysis triggers, custom analysis logic, insight generation formats.
*   **FR-SCRIPT-03 (Loading & Execution):** The library MUST provide mechanisms to load Lua scripts (e.g., from file paths specified in configuration).
*   **FR-SCRIPT-04 (Go-Lua API):** A defined API MUST be exposed from Go to Lua scripts (e.g., allowing scripts to access relevant context, invoke specific Go helper functions).
*   **FR-SCRIPT-05 (Sandboxing):** Lua execution MUST occur within a security sandbox to mitigate risks associated with running untrusted script code. Access to OS resources (filesystem, network) from Lua MUST be strictly controlled or disabled by default.

### FR-REFL: Reflection & Adaptation
*   **FR-REFL-01 (Reflection Module):** A distinct Reflection Module MUST be implemented.
*   **FR-REFL-02 (Analysis):** The module MUST be capable of analyzing past interactions, reasoning traces, and outcomes (potentially stored in LTM). Analysis can be triggered periodically or by specific events (e.g., errors).
*   **FR-REFL-03 (Insight Generation):** The module MUST generate insights regarding performance, errors, or potential improvements (potentially using an LLM).
*   **FR-REFL-04 (Feedback Loop):** Generated insights MUST be usable to adapt the agent, primarily by triggering LTM consolidation (`consolidate_ltm`) or informing future reasoning. Reflection MUST operate within an `entity_context`.

### FR-CONF: Configuration & Usability
*   **FR-CONF-01 (Configuration):** The library MUST be configurable via external files (e.g., YAML, JSON) or code. Configurable aspects MUST include: LLM choice/credentials, LTM backend type and connection details, paths to Lua scripts, reflection triggers, retrieval strategy parameters.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-PERF-01 (Performance):** The Go implementation should leverage concurrency (goroutines, channels) for efficient I/O operations (LTM access, LLM API calls) and potentially parallelizable tasks (e.g., some reflection analyses). Latency overhead from Lua execution should be minimized and measurable.
*   **NFR-SCAL-01 (Scalability):** The architecture must support scaling to handle numerous entities and potentially many agents operating concurrently within those entities. LTM backend choice will significantly impact data scalability.
*   **NFR-SECU-01 (Security):** Strict sandboxing MUST be applied to embedded Lua execution. Data isolation between entities MUST be rigorously enforced. Sensitive configuration (API keys) must be handled securely.
*   **NFR-REL-01 (Reliability):** The library should be robust with proper error handling and reporting. Concurrency mechanisms must prevent race conditions, especially around shared memory access.
*   **NFR-MAINT-01 (Maintainability):** The codebase MUST follow Go best practices, be well-structured (following layered and modular principles), documented, and include a comprehensive test suite.
*   **NFR-TEST-01 (Testability):** Modules MUST be testable in isolation, leveraging interfaces and mocking. Specific tests for multi-entity isolation and shared memory concurrency MUST be included.

*   **Benchmarking Suite:** Developing a standardized suite for evaluating CogMem agents on relevant memory, adaptation, and collaboration tasks.
*   **Observability:** Integrating logging, tracing, and metrics endpoints for monitoring agent behavior and performance.

## 8. Open Questions

*   What are the specific performance requirements (latency, throughput) for MMU operations?
*   What is the optimal granularity for Lua scripting hooks? Which specific functions need scripting access?
*   What are the default Lua sandbox restrictions? What capabilities (if any) should be exposeable via configuration?
*   What are the detailed requirements for concurrency control (locking mechanisms, conflict resolution) for shared LTM segments?
*   Which specific LTM backend adapters should be prioritized for the initial release?
