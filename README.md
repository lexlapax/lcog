    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-project-name]
    ```
2.  Install dependencies for each relevant part:
    ```bash
    # Example for backend-go (if applicable)
    cd backend-go
    go mod download
    cd ..

    # Example for frontend-react (if applicable)
    cd frontend-react
    npm install # or yarn install
