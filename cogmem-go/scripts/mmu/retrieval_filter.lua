  -- Optionally modify the query
  -- query.limit = 10
  
  -- Return the possibly modified query
  return query
end

-- Called after LTMStore.Retrieve returns results
function after_retrieve(summary)
  -- Log the summary of results
  cogmem.log("info", "MMU after_retrieve: " .. summary)
  
  -- In Phase 1, we just return the summary as is
  return summary
end

-- Called before encoding to LTM (placeholder)
function before_encode(data)
